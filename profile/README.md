## Overview

JM Custom Solutions (JMCS) is a private engineering organization dedicated to developing robust, secure, and scalable infrastructure solutions. Our focus is on creating multi-product systems that prioritize security, compliance, and operational excellence.

## Architecture

Our infrastructure is built around four core architectural themes:

### 🔐 Service Separation
Independent identity, content, and operational services with clear ownership boundaries.

### 🧩 Shared Core
Reusable modules for:
- Authentication systems
- Notification services
- File storage solutions
- Cross-product data models

### 🏗️ Product Isolation
Each product maintains its own domain logic while leveraging shared services where appropriate.

### 📋 Compliance-Aligned
- HIPAA-aware patterns
- Secure data handling
- Audit-friendly design

## Current Projects

We are actively developing several key infrastructure components:

- **Identity Management Service** - Centralized authentication and authorization
- **Shared API Layer** - Common interfaces and migration tooling
- **Product Foundations** - Core services for studio, creative, and operational applications
- **Documentation & Guides** - Internal integration resources and best practices

## Access

🔒 **Private Organization**: All repositories are private and access is granted on a per-project basis.

To request access:
1. Contact the project maintainer
2. Specify the project/repository you need access to
3. Provide your use case and requirements

## Documentation

📚 Documentation will expand as services stabilize and versioning formalizes.

Current documentation includes:
- Architecture decision records (ADRs)
- API specifications
- Integration guides
- Security guidelines

## Contributing
